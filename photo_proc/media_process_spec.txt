Nikon D90:  (raw 4288,2848) -> (1446, 960) 3:2
iPhone4:    (2592,1936) -> (1280, 960)  4:3

1. Try upload with Imagevue auto resize to 1280px bounding box. It should work after increasing MAMP Pro PHP cache size.
2. If not working, then use Photoshop image fit function to scale image’s longside to 1280 pixels. 

Note: Use sRGB color profile (Nikon default), so it will look good on the web.
